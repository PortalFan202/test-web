        Myt font size is 32 pixels! This div's margin is 1 percent of the body size.

        <p>And my font size is half of that. I also have line-height double my font size.
            In addition I have margin that is my font size.
        </p>

        <article>
            <div></div>
            I'm taking half of the height and one third of the width of the main container.
            My font size is 1.2 times the root element font size. The div upon is half my font height.
             Here's some more text so you can justify the text contents.
